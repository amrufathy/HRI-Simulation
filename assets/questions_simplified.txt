Hi, my name is Pepper. Welcome to this interview with me! After you answer each question, you will need to press the button to proceed to the next question. Take your time to give a complete answer. The more you work on your answers, the more you can get out of this interview.
I understand that you are considering changing your behaviour, and you've already taken the first step by taking part in this interview. 
During this interview, sometimes I may ask you questions that you think you've already answered. If that happens, I suggest you use it as an opportunity to think about the issue a bit more. Let's get started. 
What have you been thinking about doing regarding your behaviour?
Why have you been thinking about doing that?
If you made this change, how will that affect other areas in your life?
What improvements might you notice in the first few days?
Let's put it this way â€” What may happen in the future if you don't change anything?
Does that worry or concern you? Why?
That's great. You may find it useful to write that down. If you need a bit of a boost to your motivation over the next few days, you could try reading that over to remind yourself about what you said. All the best with your plans!
